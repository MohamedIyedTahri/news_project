## Project Summary

**News Chatbot RSS Collector** - A scalable Python application for collecting, cleaning, and storing news articles from multiple RSS sources.

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Multi-source RSS fetching**: International, tech, finance, and Arabic news feeds
- **Intelligent deduplication**: URL-based + content-based with title similarity matching  
- **Advanced text cleaning**: HTML removal, whitespace normalization
- **SQLite storage**: Structured data with metadata (title, link, date, source, category)
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Graceful feed parsing failures, network timeouts
- **Detailed logging**: INFO/WARNING/ERROR levels for monitoring
- **Scalable architecture**: Easy to add new feeds and categories

### Usage:
```bash
conda activate news-env
cd /path/to/news_project
python -m newsbot.main
```

### Database Statistics:
- Successfully processes 120+ articles from multiple sources
- Intelligent deduplication prevents duplicate storage
- Handles feed parsing errors gracefully (some Arabic feeds have format issues)

The project is ready for NLP model training and RAG pipeline integration.
